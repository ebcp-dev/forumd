The backend REST API is built with Node.js/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose. Bcrypt hashes passwords before being saved to the database. Passport.js handles user authentication and keeps them logged in through cookies.
The UI is built with React and MDBootstrap. React Router handles client-side routing and axios is used for AJAX requests to the REST API. Quill.js is used as the text editor for several forms.
